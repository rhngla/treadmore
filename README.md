### TreadMore: 

This [web app](https://rhngla.github.io/treadmore/.) (vite, react, typescript) provides audio-visual cues for randomized cadence and rhythm patterns to add some fun into long-slow treadmill-based workouts. 

### Rationale:

 - Long-slow style workouts are a helpful tool to drive [cardiovascular adaptations](https://rhngla.github.io/health-notes/posts/training-foundations/). 
 - Walking on treadmills for such workouts can feel monotonous, affecting adherence. 
 - This app provides audio-visual cues for randomized cadence and rhythm. 
 - The goal for the user is to match their stepping pattern to cues on the app. 

In my own experience, cycling (ad hoc) through different cadence and rhythm patterns (e.g. usual walking or jogging step pattern, [galloping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2CeZeCABNU) and [skipping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9MccH7mWO0) patterns) without changing treadmill settings tends to keep me mentally engaged during ~1 hour long workouts. 

I also speculate that introducing variability in movement patterns has broader benefits. It could help improve mind-body connection, enable an exploration of motor patterns, and improve ability to exploit tendon stiffness in a broader range of contexts. 

### Notes for future development:

 - Add sprites for visual cues of the different patterns. 
 - Re-visit (cadence, rhythm) combinations. 
 - Test if some ratios of the asymmetry factor are intrinsically harder than others. 
 - Connect to accelerometer data (e.g. from smart watches) to provide additional feedback and turn it into a game.
