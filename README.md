### TreadMore: 

 - Long-slow style workouts are a helpful tool to drive [cardiovascular adaptations](https://rhngla.github.io/health-notes/posts/training-foundations/). 
 - Walking on treadmills for such can feel monotonous, affecting adherence.
 - This app provides a randomized cadence and rhythm on demand. 
 - The goal for the user is to match their stepping pattern to audio-visual cues on the app. 
 
 In my personal experience, switching the rate at which I step (cadence) and also the rhythm (e.g. an asymmetric galloping pattern vs. regular walking or jogging pattern) makes the workout more engaging. 

I also speculate that introducing variability in movement patterns is generally beneficial. Instead of checking out mentally during long-slow workouts with no variability, it may be help with better mind-body connection, an intentional exploration of motor patterns, and having a deeper sense of tendon involvement in rhythmic movements.
